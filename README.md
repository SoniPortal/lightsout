# lightsout
A simulation of the Lights Out puzzle that I made in like 2018 or something. I optimised the click detection right before I uploaded this repository, which was the only edit I made since years before.

Click on squares to toggle the lights and press R to randomise (note: not all randomised positions will be solvable)
