# lightsout
A simulation of the Lights Out puzzle which I originally programmed around 2018. Some changes have been made since then

## Controls
Click on squares to toggle the lights and press R to randomise (note: not all randomised positions will be solvable)

## Changelog
Right before upload: made click detection algorithm better
